# Classification using KNN and RNN Algorithms

# Goal
This lab uses the Wine dataset to evaluate how efficiently the K-Nearest Neighbors and Radius Neighbors classifiers perform.

# Used Tools
Python
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook 

## Important Results
KNN accuracy is dependent on the value of k.
The choice of radius has an impact on RNN.
KNN's performance was more consistent.
RNN needed to be carefully adjusted.

# Difficulties
Choosing appropriate radius values.
Managing RNN's unclassified points.
Recognizing errors in accuracy.

# Final Thoughts
For this dataset, KNN was more dependable, but RNN performance fluctuated according to radius.
